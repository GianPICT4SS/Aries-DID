# Aries Cloud Controller Node

## Quickstart

Clone the repository locally.

Run in docker:

`$ cd ./docker`
`$ sh manage up`

In this example we're running a demo with three Agents; Alice, Faber and Acme. We're also running a small ledger network. Configuration details for this set up can be seen inside "docker/manage" and "docker/docker-compose.yml". In this example, we use a web front-end to communicate with our Agents. This allows us to create, issue and verify credentials.

For Alice, navigate to: http://localhost:4200
For Faber, navigate to: http://localhost:4201
For Acme, navigate to: http://localhost:4202
